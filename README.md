# Deep Learning Paper Re-implementations

This repository focuses on re-implementing classic and influential **Deep Learning research papers**, mainly in the field of **Computer Vision**, with the goal of deeply understanding their core ideas and training details rather than just using existing libraries.

## Scope

* Re-implementation of well-known DL architectures from original papers
* Emphasis on clarity, correctness, and educational value
* Experiments are primarily conducted on **CIFAR-10**

## Implemented Models

* **ResNet**
* **DenseNet**

(More architectures will be added over time.)

## Dataset

* **CIFAR-10**

The dataset is chosen for fast experimentation and fair comparison between different architectures.

## Future Plans

* Add more paper implementations in computer vision
* Write accompanying **blog posts** explaining:

  * Theoretical background
  * Architectural design choices
  * Training tricks and pitfalls
  * Personal insights from re-implementation

## Motivation

The purpose of this project is to strengthen understanding of deep learning models by building them from scratch and bridging the gap between research papers and practical implementation.
